# AID-Challenges

## Challenge 1 - Interactive Selection of Generative Art

These algorithmically generated figures evolve over time, following the genetic algorithm steps of selection and reproduction. The fitness of a figure is tied to the length of time that the user rolls the mouse over the figure. This is known as interactive selection, a genetic algorithm with fitness values assigned by users. 

Inspired by the books ‘The Nature of Code’ by Daniel Shiffman, and ‘Generative Art, a practical guide using processing’, by Matt Pearson.

## Challenge 2 - Ultrasonic Range with Arduino

This rangefinder can detect distances from 2cm to 400cm with an accuracy of ±3mm. 

The detected distance is displayed on the LCD in real time. When the object is outside the detection range, the message 'Out of Range' is displayed. The thermistor allows for more accurate measurements by taking into account the temperature in the room and how it influences the speed of sound.

## Challenge 3 - Interactive Generative Art using OSC

This geometric figure changes shape according to the user's inputs. The sketch AID_Figure is controlled by AID_Slider through the packages oscP5 and controlP5.

Inspired by the Sutcliffe Pentagon case study, from the book ‘Generative Art, a practical guide using processing’, by Matt Pearson
